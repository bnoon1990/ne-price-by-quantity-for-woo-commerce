This plugin enables variable pricing to be added for simple and variable products in WooCommerce. 

== Description ==

This plugin, Price By Quantity For WooCommerce, made by Noon Elite, is designed to enhance your WooCommerce store by adding a new pricing model based on quantity. 

With this plugin, you can set different prices for different quantities of a product. This is particularly useful for stores that sell products in bulk and want to offer discounts for larger quantities. 

For example, you can set the price of a product to be $10 for quantities of 1-10, $9 for quantities of 11-20, and so on. This encourages customers to buy in larger quantities to take advantage of the lower prices.

The plugin is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with your WooCommerce store. You can set the quantity-based prices directly in the product settings in your WooCommerce dashboard. 

The plugin also works with all types of products - simple, variable, grouped, and external.
